%% Nonparametric Estimates of Cumulative Distribution Functions and Their Inverses
% This example shows how to estimate the cumulative distribution function
% (CDF) from data in a non-parametric or semi-parametric fashion. It also
% illustrates the inversion method for generating random numbers from the
% estimated CDF. The Statistics Toolbox(TM) includes more than two dozen random 
% number generator functions for parametric univariate probability distributions. 
% These functions allow you to generate random inputs for a wide variety of 
% simulations, however, there are situations where it is necessary to generate 
% random values to simulate data that are not described by a simple parametric 
% family.
%
% The toolbox also includes the functions |pearsrnd| and |johnsrnd|, for
% generating random values without having to specify a parametric distribution
% from which to drawREPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASHthose functions allow you to specify a distribution in
% terms of its moments or quantiles, respectively.
%
% However, there are still situations where even more flexibility is needed,
% to generate random values that "imitate" data that you have collected even
% more closely. In this case, you might use a nonparametric estimate of the
% CDF of those data, and use the inversion method to generate random values.  
% The inversion method involves generating uniform random values on the unit 
% interval, and transforming them to a desired distribution using the inverse 
% CDF for that distribution.
%
% From the opposite perspective, it is sometimes desirable to use a
% nonparametric estimate of the CDF to transform observed data onto the unit
% interval, giving them an approximate uniform distribution.
%
% The |ecdf| function computes one type of nonparametric CDF estimate, the
% empirical CDF, which is a stairstep function.  This example illustrates some
% smoother alternatives, which may be more suitable for simulating or
% transforming data from a continuous distribution.

% Another way to generate simulated data using kernel estimation is to use

r = ksdensity(x, u, 'function','icdf', 'width',.35);

% However, using the latter method can be time-consuming for large amounts of

% the original data and add some appropriate random noise.
r = datasample(x,100000,'replace',true) + normrnd(0,.35,100000,1);

%%
% If you generate enough random values, a histogram of the result follows the
% kernel density estimate of the original data very closely.

%% A Semiparametric CDF Estimate
% A nonparametric CDF estimate requires a good deal of data to achieve
% reasonable precision.  In addition, data only affect the estimate "locally."
% That is, in regions where there is a high density of data, the estimate is
% based on more observations than in regions where there is a low density of
% data.  In particular, nonparametric estimates do not perform well in the
% tails of a distribution, where data are sparse by definition.
%
% Fitting a semiparametric model to your data using the |paretotails| function
% allows the best of both the nonparametric and parametric worlds.  In the
% "center" of the distribution, the model uses the piecewise linear
% nonparametric estimate for the CDF.  In each tail, it uses a generalized
% Pareto distribution.  The generalized Pareto is often used as a model for
% the tail(s) of a dataset, and while it is flexible enough to fit a wide
% variety of distribution tails, it is sufficiently constrained so that it
% requires few data to provide a plausible and smooth fit to tail data.
%
% For example, you might define the "center" of the data as the middle 50%, and
% specify that the transitions between the nonparametric estimate and the Pareto
% fits take place at the .25 and .75 quantiles of your data.  To evaluate the
% CDF of the semiparametric model fit, use the fit's |cdf| method.
semipFit = paretotails(x,.25,.75);
%%
% The warning is due to using so few data REPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASH 6 points in each tail in this
% case REPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASH and indicates that the fitted generalized Pareto distribution in the
% upper tail extends exactly to the smallest observation, and no further.  You
% can see that in the histogram shown below.  In a real application, you would
% usually have more data, and the warning would typically not occur.
[p,q] = boundary(semipFit);
y = linspace(-4,6,1000);
Fy = cdf(semipFit,y);
plot(y,Fy,'b-', q,p,'k+');
xlim([-6.5 5]); xlabel('x'); ylabel('F(x)');
legend({'Semi-parametric Estimate' 'Segment Boundaries'},'location','NW');

%%
% To transform uniform random values back to the scale of your original data,
% use the fit's |icdf| method.
r = icdf(semipFit,u);
hist(r,-6.5:.25:5);
xlabel('x'); ylabel('Frequency');

%%
% This semiparametric estimate has smoothed the tails of the data more than
% the center, because of the parametric model used in the tails.  In that
% sense, the estimate is more similar to the piecewise linear estimate than to
% the kernel estimate. However, it is also possible to use |paretotails| to
% create a semiparametric fit that uses kernel estimation in the center of the
% data.


%% Conclusions
% This example illustrates three methods for computing a non- or semi-parametric
% CDF or inverse CDF estimate from data.  The three methods impose different
% amounts and types of smoothing on the data.  Which method you choose depends
% on how each method captures or fails to capture what you consider the
% important features of your data.
