%% Classification
% This example shows how to perform classification using discriminant
% analysis, NaiveBayes classifier, and decision trees. Suppose you have a
% data set containing observations with measurements on different variables
% (called predictors) and their known class labels. If you obtain predictor
% values for new observations, could you determine to which classes those
% observations probably belong?  This is the problem of classification.

%% Fisher's Iris Data
% Fisher's iris data consists of measurements on the sepal length, sepal
% width, petal length, and petal width for 150 iris specimens.  There are
% 50 specimens from each of three species. Load the data and see how the
% sepal measurements differ between species. You can use the two columns
% containing sepal measurements.

load fisheriris
gscatter(meas(:,1), meas(:,2), species,'rgb','osd');
xlabel('Sepal length');
ylabel('Sepal width');
N = size(meas,1);
%%
% Suppose you measure a sepal and petal from an iris, and you need to
% determine its species on the basis of those measurements. One approach to
% solving this problem is known as discriminant analysis.

%% Linear and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis
% The |classify| function can perform classification using different types
% of discriminant analysis. First classify the data using the default
% linear discriminant analysis (LDA).

ldaClass = classify(meas(:,1:2),meas(:,1:2),species);

%%
% The observations with known class labels are usually called the training
% data. Now compute the resubstitution error, which is the
% misclassification error (the proportion of misclassified observations) on
% the training set.

bad = ~strcmp(ldaClass,species);
ldaResubErr = sum(bad) / N
%%
% You can also compute the confusion matrix on the training set. A
% confusion matrix contains information about known class labels and
% predicted class labels. Generally speaking, the (i,j) element in the
% confusion matrix is the number of samples whose known class label is
% class i and whose predicted class is j.  The diagonal elements represent
% correctly classified observations. 

[ldaResubCM,grpOrder] = confusionmat(species,ldaClass)
%%
% Of the 150 training observations, 20% or 30 observations are
% misclassified by the linear discriminant function. You can see which ones
% they are by drawing X through the misclassified points.

hold on;
plot(meas(bad,1), meas(bad,2), 'kx');
hold off;

%%
% The function has separated the plane into regions divided by lines, and
% assigned different regions to different species.  One way to visualize
% these regions is to create a grid of (x,y) values and apply the
% classification function to that grid.

[x,y] = meshgrid(4:.1:8,2:.1:4.5);
x = x(:);
y = y(:);
j = classify([x y],meas(:,1:2),species);
gscatter(x,y,j,'grb','sod')


%%
% For some data sets, the regions for the various classes are not well
% separated by lines. When that is the case, linear discriminant analysis
% is not appropriate. Instead, you can try quadratic discriminant analysis
% (QDA) for our data.
%
% Compute the resubstitution error for quadratic discriminant analysis.
qdaClass = classify(meas(:,1:2),meas(:,1:2),species,'quadratic');
bad = ~strcmp(qdaClass,species);
qdaResubErr = sum(bad) / N

%% 
% You have computed the resubstitution error. Usually people are more
% interested in the test error (also referred to as generalization error),
% which is the expected prediction error on an independent set. In fact,
% the resubstitution error will likely under-estimate the test error.
%
% In this case you don't have another labeled data set, but you can
% simulate one by doing cross-validation. A stratified 10-fold
% cross-validation is a popular choice for estimating the test error on
% classification algorithms. It randomly divides the training set into 10
% disjoint subsets. Each subset has roughly equal size and roughly the same
% class proportions as in the training set. Remove one subset, train the
% classification model using the other nine subsets, and use the trained
% model to classify the removed subset. You could repeat this by removing
% each of the ten subsets one at a time.
%
% Because cross-validation randomly divides data, its outcome depends on
% the initial random seed. To reproduce the exact results in this example,
% execute the following command:

rng(0,'twister');

% First use |cvpartition| to generate 10 disjoint stratified subsets.

%% Decision Tree
%
% Another classification algorithm is based on a decision tree. A decision

% nonparametric because they do not require any assumptions about the

%
% The |classregtree| class creates a decision tree. Create a decision tree

% For the decision tree algorithm, the cross-validation error
% estimate is significantly larger than the resubstitution error. This
% shows that the generated tree overfits the training set. In other words,
% this is a tree that classifies the original training set well, but
% the structure of the tree is sensitive to this particular training set so
% that its performance on new data is likely to degrade. It is often
% possible to find a simpler tree that performs better than a more
% complex tree on new data.  
%
% Try pruning the tree. First compute the resubstitution error for various
% of subsets of the original tree. Then compute the cross-validation error
% for these sub-trees. A graph shows that the resubstitution error is
% overly optimistic. It always decreases as the tree size grows, but beyond
% a certain point, increasing the tree size increases the cross-validation
% error rate.

resubcost = test(t,'resub');
[cost,secost,ntermnodes,bestlevel] = test(t,'cross',meas(:,1:2),species);
plot(ntermnodes,cost,'b-', ntermnodes,resubcost,'rREPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASH')
figure(gcf);
xlabel('Number of terminal nodes');
ylabel('Cost (misclassification error)')

% Which tree should you choose? A simple rule would be to choose the tree
% with the smallest cross-validation error.  While this may be
% satisfactory, you might prefer to use a simpler tree if it is roughly as
% good as a more complex tree. For this example, take the simplest tree
% that is within one standard error of the minimum.  That's the default
% rule used by the |classregtree/test| method.
%
% You can show this on the graph by computing a cutoff value that is equal
% to the minimum cost plus one standard error.  The "best" level computed
% by the |classregtree/test| method is the smallest tree under this cutoff.
% (Note that bestlevel=0 corresponds to the unpruned tree, so you have to
% add 1 to use it as an index into the vector outputs from
% |classregtree/test|.)

[mincost,minloc] = min(cost);
cutoff = mincost + secost(minloc);
hold on
plot([0 20], [cutoff cutoff], 'k:')
plot(ntermnodes(bestlevel+1), cost(bestlevel+1), 'mo')
legend('Cross-validation','Resubstitution','Min + 1 std. err.','Best choice')
hold off

%%
% Finally, you can look at the pruned tree and compute the estimated
% misclassification error for it. 

pt = prune(t,bestlevel);
view(pt)

cost(bestlevel+1)

%% Conclusions
% This example shows how to perform classification in MATLAB(R) using
% Statistics Toolbox functions.
%
% This example is not meant to be an ideal analysis of the Fisher
% iris data, In fact, using the petal measurements instead of, or in
% addition to, the sepal measurements may lead to better classification.
% Also, this example is not meant to compare the strengths and
% weaknesses of different classification algorithms. You may find it
% instructive to perform the analysis on other data sets and compare
% different algorithms. There are also Statistics Toolbox functions that
% implement other classification algorithms. For instance, you can use
% |TreeBagger| to perform bootstrap aggregation for an ensemble of decision
% trees, as described in the example
