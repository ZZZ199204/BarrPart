%PROCESSPARALLELANDSTREAMOPTIONS vets and organizes parallel and stream info.
% 
%   The command line arguments together define a set of ground rules as to 
%   how random number streams are to be utilized during a sequence of computations.
%   The input argument "opt" supplies the first three of the effective
%   arguments listed below.
%
%   The effective arguments are:
%
%      useParallel        boolean      Use parfor-loops in place
%                                      of for-loops (T/F).
%      useSubstreams      boolean      Use a separate Substream for each iterate
%                                      of the loop, both in for-loops and in
%                                      parfor-loops) (T/F).
%      streams            cell array   RandStream object(s), can be empty.
%      multipleStreams    boolean      Allow multiple user-supplied streams 
%                                      to be distributed to workers in a 
%                                      matlabpool (T/F).  Some toolbox commands
%                                      will support this paradigm, others not.
%
%   The return values are:
%
%      useParallel        boolean      Use parfor loops (T/F) vs for-loops.
%      RNGscheme          struct       Contains essential and convenience 
%                                      information defining the ground rules, 
%                                      or "scheme" for RNG use.
%      poolsz             integer      The size of the matlabpool to be used
%                                      for computation.  The value is zero if
%                                      no matlabpool is open or if useParallel
%                                      is false.
%
%   Contents of the RNGscheme struct are:
%      uuid               string       Unique identifier for the RNGscheme
%      useSubstreams      boolean      As described above
%      streams            cell array   As described above
%      valid              boolean      RNGscheme is currently valid 
%      useDefaultStream   boolean      RNGscheme uses the default RandStream
%      streamsOnPool      boolean      RNGscheme deploys multiple streams on the 
%                                      matlabpool
%
%   Notes:
%      1. The purpose of the field "uuid" is to support persistence of the
%         RNGscheme and allow multiple RNGschemes to be available at the
%         same time.
%      2. The value for "uuid" is derived using the command "tempname".
%         The documentation for "tempname" indicates that, when running
%         MATLAB without a JVM, the value for "uuid" is almost
%         certain to be unique, but the guarantee is not absolute.
%         We only require uniqueness for the lifetime of the MATLAB executable
%         in which the RNGscheme is created (this is the client executable
%         when there is a matlabpool open).
%      3. The field "valid" is intended to be writeable.  All other fields
%         should be immutable, once the RNGscheme struct has been initialized.
%      4. An RNGscheme will become invalid under the following conditions:
%         a. The RNGscheme was created for parallel computation with multiple 
%            streams and an open matlabpool, and that matlabpool has since 
%            been closed.
%         b. The RNGscheme was created for parallel computation with multiple 
%            streams and an open matlabpool.  Subsequently, serial computation
%            is requested, using the RNGscheme.
%         c. The RNGscheme was created without a matlabpool, but with a
%            RandStream object supplied in the command line argument "streams".
%            Subsequently, a matlabpool is open, and parallel computation
%            is attempted, using the RNGscheme.

%
%   This is a utility function used to support statistics functions that may
%   employ parfor-loops. The function checks that options affecting random 
%   number usage are valid in the current execution environment.
%   Invalid combinations of options cause an exception to be thrown.
%   The options to be validated are:
%
%      useParallel      boolean       Use parfor-loops in place
%                                     of for-loops (T/F).

%                                     of the loop, both in for-loops and in
%                                     parfor-loops) (T/F).
%      streams          cell array    RandStream object(s), can be empty.
%      multipleStreams  boolean       Allow multiple user-supplied streams 
%                                     to be distributed to workers in a 
%                                     matlabpool (T/F).  Some toolbox commands
%                                     will support this paradigm, others not.
%
%   The return values are:
%
%      streamsOnPool    boolean       Multiple user-supplied streams are to be
%                                     used by workers in the matlabpool (T/F).
%      poolsz           integer       The size of the matlabpool to be used
%                                     for computation.  The value is zero if
%                                     no matlabpool is open or if useParallel
%                                     is false.
%
%   Factors determining validity are:
%
%      (1) Availability of the Parallel Computing Toolbox (PCT)
%          (ie, licensing and installation)
%      (2) Presence or absence of an open matlabpool
%      (3) Statistics Toolbox guidelines for random number stream usage
%          in serial and parallel contexts.
%
%   The rules determining validity are:
%
%      (1) useParallel (ie, parfor) is valid w/wo PCT
%      (2) useParallel (ie, parfor) is valid w/wo a matlabpool
%          (parfor loops run in serial on the client if no matlabpool)
%      (3) streams must be empty or scalar unless all of the following hold
%             useParallel     is true
%             a matlabpool    is open
%             multipleStreams is true

%             we return streamsOnPool = true
%             (otherwise, streamsOnPool = false)
%      (4) If useSubstreams is true the stream type must support Substreams.
%          The calling convention of this function is that if useSubstreams
%          is true, then the streams argument cannot be empty; a scalar
%          value must be supplied.
