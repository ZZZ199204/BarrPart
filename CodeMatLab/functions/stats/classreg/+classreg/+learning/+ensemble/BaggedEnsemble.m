        %FRESAMPLE Fraction of training data for resampling.
        %   The FResample property is a numeric scalar between 0 and 1. It is set
        %   to the fraction of the training data resampled at random for every weak
        %   learner in this ensemble.

        FResample;
        
        %REPLACE Flag indicating if training data were sampled with replacement.
        %   The Replace property is a logical flag. It is set to true if the
        %   training data for weak learners in this ensemble were sampled with
        %   replacement and set to false otherwise.

        %USEOBSFORLEARNER Use observations for learners.
        %   The UseObsForLearner property is a logical matrix of size
        %   N-by-NTrained, where N is the number of observations in the training
        %   data and NTrained is the number of trained weak learners. An element
        %   (I,J) of this matrix is set to true if observation I was used for
        %   training learner J and set to false otherwise.
